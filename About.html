                    <h2 class="pt-4 pb-3 sub-heading">What is AlphaPlay</h2>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">AlphaPlay represents the ultimate opportunity to materialise your passion for crypto, e-sports and gaming into something tangible and profitable! In essence, AlphaPlay represents the departure for those who dare to commence a unique crypto gaming journey! </p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">Overall, AlphaPlay is a gaming token that was developed on the Binance Smart Chain with the goal of rewarding users for engaging in games they like, fulfilling goals, and attending events and competitions. </p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">Moving forward, our primary goal is to create a gaming community in which people can come together to compete, earn prizes, and/or establish a career while still feeling appreciated for what they do in their leisure time.</p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">Furthermore, we want to offer gaming money that can be used and accepted in the AlphaPlay store as well as on a range of well-known gaming platforms in the future.</p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us"> We are working on four main gaming platforms such as Steam , Epic Games, Battle.net, Ubisoft as well as on individual games .</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="pb-3 sub-heading">ECO System</h4>

                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us pt-3">The Play2Earn ecosystem represents the ideal framework to reward players for their efforts and time invested in our platform.</p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">Hence, players will be able to do the following:</p>
                    <ul class="for-paragraph-about-us ps-4">
                        <li class="mb-2">Utilise those tokens to purchase merchandise in-store;</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Place bets on their favourite teams;</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Organise tournaments;</li>
                        <li class="mb-4">Sell tokens in the liquidity pool.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">Moreover, Alphaplay will generate revenue via eSports, betting, garment sales, and the marketing of game studios. The funds obtained will be used to acquire back tokens and reintroduce them into circulation, hence increasing the value of tokens. </p>

                    <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3 sub-heading">Tournaments</h2>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">To leverage the potential of e-sports, AlphaPlay will be hosting official tournaments. To ensure decentralisation and security, all competitions will be held using blockchain technology.</p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">Anyone is welcome to join and participate in them, as there will be no entry fee for official competitions since they will be prefunded by sponsors and partners. Non-official or custom-created tournaments, matches, and games will operate in a different manner and will need each player to support their participation by paying a participation fee. </p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">Each event or match hosted on the platform will result in a 0.5 percent fee being paid to AlphaPlay. There will be two sorts of competitions: team tournaments and solo tournaments.</p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">Teams will need to be preregistered, and the team captain will be able to participate in tournaments on the team’s behalf. AlphaPlay will feature all the most popular gaming competitions and will continue to grow in response to user demand.</p>
                    <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3 sub-heading">Betting</h2>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">At all formal competitions, you will have the opportunity to place a wager on your favourite team. </p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">Betting on non-official tournaments and matches has a significant risk of fraud and scams, thus, we strongly advise you to verify trust scores before placing your bets and make sure that validators sanction the events you are betting on. </p>
                    <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3 sub-heading">Validator</h2>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">Validators will monitor and validate each tournament to guarantee their security and avoid fraud. For this endeavour, validators receive a percentage of a total price pool.</p>

                    <h2 id="simple-list-item-4">Ways to earn</h2>
                    <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3 sub-heading">Play2Earn</h2>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">A platform monetisation mechanism for players and developers, Play-to-Earn (P2E) enables all game participants to swap game objects for digital currency, and it is becoming more popular. The growth of Play-to-Earn will result in a shift in gaming patterns, most likely resulting in the transformation of current large-scale initiatives. At this time, this technique has not been implemented on a large scale worldwide.</p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">In AlphaPlay, the P2E feature will offer distinct seasons that will last 3 months. Throughout the season, players’ primary focus will be on gaining the most amount of experience possible to get a better rating. </p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">Everyone who finishes at top best position the season will get season incentives such as bonus tokens, merchandise, or digital goods. All other participants will earn tokens depending on their experience over the season. Season awards will be given out at the conclusion of the season, and tokens will be given out regularly.</p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">Ultimately, you will gain experience by fulfilling daily activities, participating in tournaments, or playing games you like playing. P2E is poised to become a compelling component of the decentralised ecosystem in the near future. With their unique advances and enticing financial incentives, they have the potential to become some of the most popular games available in the future.</p>
                    <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3 sub-heading">Validator</h2>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">You may earn tokens from tournaments by progressing to the validator position, which opens up a limitless number of opportunities in AplhaPlay. </p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">⦁ It will be required to stake your tokens as collateral, which will be taken from your account if it is determined that you committed fraud by falsifying results. </p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">⦁ Your tasks will involve participating in tournaments and checking Oracle data to guarantee that no cheating or other forms of fraud are taking place on the site. </p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">⦁ Alternatively, you will get a portion of the prize pool from an event in return. A set percentage is created for each event and shown before competitors are allowed to participate as a validator </p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">⦁ Multiple validators are permitted for each event, and the awards will be distributed in an equitable manner. The tournament’s rules determine this and the number of validators required. You will also get season experience and a trust score for your efforts as a validator. </p>
                    <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3 sub-heading">Staking</h2>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">We leverage crypto staking, a method of generating passive revenue by employing particular cryptocurrencies to assist in verifying transactions on a blockchain network. In general, the more the amount at risk, the greater the likelihood that a user will receive transaction fee incentives.</p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">We would want to thank our most devoted members by offering them staking. It is possible to stake your tokens and receive an interest rate on the money you have invested in them. </p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">⦁ The tokens you stake will be locked up in a smart contract for a period of time during which you will not be able to access them. </p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">⦁ Your tokens, as well as any interest accrued throughout the staking term, will be returned to you at the end of the time. </p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">⦁ To calculate the interest rate, the time spent staking must be taken into consideration. </p>
                    <h2 class="pt-5 pb-3 sub-heading">Referrals</h2>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">You may participate in the referral program by introducing your friends and earning tokens in a passive manner in this way. </p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">As a result of inviting your friend, you will get tokens not just for inviting him, but also for the other players he invites to the party. </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h2 id="simple-list-item-5">NFT's</h2>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">Like the majority of cryptocurrency projects, AlphaPlay has its own NFTs. In terms of providing genuine value to investors, there is presently just one NFT that does so as a consequence of the passive earnings increases and other offered advantages.</p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">AlphaPlay NFTs will be more focused on our presently developing and upcoming game during the next several months. They will also have a monetary value and benefits associated with them, and they will be possible to trade or stake as payment on an online betting system</p>
                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">NFTs are going to shake up our conceptions of intellectual property and ownership. Given the fact that transaction history is continuously documented and publicly accessible, it will be simple to identify producers, purchasers, and the buying history of digital items, further destabilising the creative industry in the process.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p class="for-paragraph-about-us">In the real world, things such as gaming computers, monitors, virtual reality headsets, keyboards, and other gaming equipment will be available at the AlphaPlay store.
